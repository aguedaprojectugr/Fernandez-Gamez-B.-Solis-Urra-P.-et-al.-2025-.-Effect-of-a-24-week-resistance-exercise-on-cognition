# Effect of a 24-week resistance exercise intervention on cognitive function in cognitively normal older adults: The AGUEDA Randomized Controlled Trial
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION: Resistance exercise (RE) may benefit cognition in aging. This study assessed the effects of a 24-week RE program on executive function (EF) and other cognitive domains in cognitively healthy older adults.

METHODS: Ninety participants were randomized to an RE group or a control group. Cognitive and physical function were evaluated pre- and post-intervention.
RESULTS: EF improved in both groups, with no significant between-group difference in overall EF. However, the RE group showed a significant improvement in attentional/inhibitory control. No significant effects were found in other cognitive domains.
The RE group also improved significantly in lower-body strength, which was positively associated with gains in EF and episodic memory. Subgroup analyses suggested greater benefits for participants with lower education or higher subjective cognitive decline.

DISCUSSION: While global EF changes did not differ, RE led to significant gains in inhibition. Physical strength may play a key role in cognitive enhancement in aging.
The trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05186090)
